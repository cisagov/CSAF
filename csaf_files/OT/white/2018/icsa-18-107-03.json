A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume memory and eventually reload, resulting in a DoS condition. CVE-2018-0158 has been assigned to this vulnerability.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device. When the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with elevated privileges. The attacker could also leverage this vulnerability to cause the device to reload, causing a temporary DoS condition while the device is reloading.
