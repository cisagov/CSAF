If these preconditions are fulfilled, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted message to the RTU500, causing the targeted RTU500 CMU to reboot. The vulnerability is caused by a missing input data validation, which eventually, if exploited, could cause an internal buffer to overflow in the HCI IEC 60870-5-104 function.",
