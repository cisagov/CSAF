To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.",

If the function succeeds then the \"name_out\", \"header\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.",

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream. The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.",

X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.",

          "text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: IB/hfi1: Fix bugs with non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec user SDMA requests hfi1 user SDMA request processing has two bugs that can cause data corruption for user SDMA requests that have multiple payload iovecs where an iovec other than the tail iovec does not run up to the page boundary for the buffer pointed to by that iovec.a Here are the specific bugs: 1. user_sdma_txadd() does not use struct user_sdma_iovec->iov.iov_len. Rather, user_sdma_txadd() will add up to PAGE_SIZE bytes from iovec to the packet, even if some of those bytes are past iovec->iov.iov_len and are thus not intended to be in the packet. 2. user_sdma_txadd() and user_sdma_send_pkts() fail to advance to the next iovec in user_sdma_request->iovs when the current iovec is not PAGE_SIZE and does not contain enough data to complete the packet. The transmitted packet will contain the wrong data from the iovec pages. This has not been an issue with SDMA packets from hfi1 Verbs or PSM2 because they only produce iovecs that end short of PAGE_SIZE as the tail iovec of an SDMA request. Fixing these bugs exposes other bugs with the SDMA pin cache (struct mmu_rb_handler) that get in way of supporting user SDMA requests with multiple payload iovecs whose buffers do not end at PAGE_SIZE. So this commit fixes those issues as well. Here are the mmu_rb_handler bugs that non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec payload user SDMA requests can hit: 1. Overlapping memory ranges in mmu_rb_handler will result in duplicate pinnings. 2. When extending an existing mmu_rb_handler entry (struct mmu_rb_node), the mmu_rb code (1) removes the existing entry under a lock, (2) releases that lock, pins the new pages, (3) then reacquires the lock to insert the extended mmu_rb_node. If someone else comes in and inserts an overlapping entry between (2) and (3), insert in (3) will fail. The failure path code in this case unpins _all_ pages in either the original mmu_rb_node or the new mmu_rb_node that was inserted between (2) and (3). 3. In hfi1_mmu_rb_remove_unless_exact(), mmu_rb_node->refcount is incremented outside of mmu_rb_handler->lock. As a result, mmu_rb_node could be evicted by another thread that gets mmu_rb_handler->lock and checks mmu_rb_node->refcount before mmu_rb_node->refcount is incremented. 4. Related to #2 above, SDMA request submission failure path does not check mmu_rb_node->refcount before freeing mmu_rb_node object. If there are other SDMA requests in progress whose iovecs have pointers to the now-freed mmu_rb_node(s), those pointers to the now-freed mmu_rb nodes will be dereferenced when those SDMA requests complete.",
