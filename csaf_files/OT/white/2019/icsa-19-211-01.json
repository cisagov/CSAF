If that is true, then the defects related to those protocols do not apply in practice. Also a successful exploit of the bootrom network stack has a more difficult timing component. In typical applications, the bootrom does not listen to TCP-ports, which means that the TCP-related issues must be timed with the target downloading data from the network.",

The buffer overflow occurs in the task calling recv()/recvfrom()/recvmsg(). Applications that pass a buffer equal to or larger than a full TCP-window are not susceptible to this attack.
